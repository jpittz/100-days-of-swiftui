# 100-days-of-swiftui

**Current Day: 21**

## Purpose

I've created this repo to log my work and track my progress for my first 100 days learning Swift & SwiftUI. This is also my first time using Git, so the two together are providing me with a steep learning curve. I aim to complete this course with a better understanding of SwiftUI so that I can continue to develop for iOS and other Apple operating systems. I'm expecting to make many mistakes and spend plenty of time researching when I get stuck, but I understand that it is all part of the process.

## Highlights

#### Day 9

I found Checkpoint 5 (Day 9) difficult as I was introduced to closures, as well as its short-hand syntax. I spent a lot longer attempting to solve it than the previous 4 checkpoints, spending time re-watching previous videos to better understand how to tackle the problem. The solution came to me when I understood how the functions could be chained on one line, meaning I didn't need any temporary arrays. This checkpoint taught me that closures aren't easy to learn initially and that they are something I'd like to finish the course with a better understanding of.

#### Day 17

I have now successfully built my first iOS app using SwiftUI: a Tip Calculator.
